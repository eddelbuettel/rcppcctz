SystemRequirements: A 64-bit POSIX OS such as Linux or OS X with IANA time
 zone data in /usr/share/zoneinfo as well as a recent-enough C++11 compiler
 (such as g++-4.9 or later which is preferred, g++-4.8 works too). On Windows
 the zoneinfo included with R is used; and time parsing support is enabled
 via a backport of std::get_time from the LLVM libc++ library.
